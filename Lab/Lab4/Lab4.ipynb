    "In order to model the motion of gravitationally interacting bodies, it is necessary to be able to instruct a computer to calculate a gravitational force and to display an arrow representing the force. Before doing this activity you should have read Section 3.6 of the *Matter & Interactions, 4ed.* textbook, which discusses the structure of a computational model that includes the gravitational force.\n",
    "\n",
    "After completing this activity you should be able to:\n",
    "* Write a VPython program to calculate a gravitational force\n",
    "* To create and scale an `arrow` to represent a vector quantity such as a force on an object\n",
    "* To write a `while` loop that creates multiple objects and performs the same calculation on each one\n",
